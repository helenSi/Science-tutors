				<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
				<p>I have ten years experience in teaching Biology and ICT in Secondary School and Further Education College. Mainly GCSE and A level standard on an Access to Higher Education Health &amp; Health Science and BTEC Forensic Science course.</p>
		 		<p>I have taught all aspects of Biology from Genetics, Health &amp; Disease to Anatomy.</p>

				<p>I completed my PGCE in 2006. I have a BSc and PhD in Microbiology from the University of Surrey.</p>

				<h3>Teaching </h3>
				<p>I have a very friendly approach. Biology is a fascinating subject and so it is a joy to teach - the only problem is that there is so much to learn!</p>
				<p>I like to use activities and visual aids to help teach the more complex concepts with questions and discussions to reinforce understanding.  I believe learning is a social activity and I try to make both the learning and teaching process as enjoyable as possible.</p>
